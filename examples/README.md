## Running Examples

Make sure you're in the project root directory and have trained a model first:

```bash
# Train a model first
python train_from_collections.py

# Then run examples
python examples/use_trained_model.py
python examples/api_usage_example.py
python examples/example_usage.py
```

## Customizing Examples

Edit the examples to:
- Change the model path
- Try different configuration lines
- Use your own argspecs
- Test with your specific use cases
